The process:

  1) Develop a component
  
  2) Create a MXML component in src/demos that tests and illustrates the functionality of the component
  
     Follow the example given in src/demos/ColorAnimationDemo.mxml. The component should contain a
     800px VBox that contains the component to be tested, a grey bar, and a text area on the right
     that explains what the expected behavior is as different manipulations are performed.
    
     One-off additional controls needed for the demo should be placed in /src/controls

  3) Reference the component in the viewstack in JuiceKitTests.mxml. This will allow us to cycle through
    all the components and test their functionality. Selected demos will be used to explain introduce 
    JuiceKit to developers and will ALSO be placed in JuiceKitDemos.mxml. This application will be
    published on the juicekit.org site. What we're looking for in JuiceKitDemos is demos that:
  
      * Simple demonstrations of key features of JuiceKit that we want developers to know about
      * Help developers navigate JK. The ColorPalette demo is an example of this. It helps developers 
        explore palettes, find the one they want, and supplies the source code to recreate that palette.
      * Help us test and exercise JK. The ColorPalette demo displays nearly all of the JK ColorPalettes 
        and let's you transform them. This has revealed some calculation problems in the Colors class.
      * The source code should represent the canonical (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical, one 
        of Chris' favorite words) way of building certain visualizations. The TreeMapGraphUtil.mxml 
        demo is an example of this.

This project contains two Applications.
  
  JuiceKitDemos.mxml : Will be used as a technical demonstration of key JK features
  JuiceKitTests.mxml : Contains a viewstack with components for all testable demos.
